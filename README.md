# tfbind8-project

### Dataset
We are using tf bind 8 as a dataset, however the implementation didn't work flawless, so we had to do some changes in the source code. That's what got saved to 'tf_bind_8_dataset.py'

### Scorer
We trained a scorer to approximate the black box function f, which are the y-values associated with the x-data. For that a RF model and an MLP were trained.

### Generator
Todo
